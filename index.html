<!-- The short bio -->
		<div id="bio">
			<p> I was born in CapeTown, and grew up in Oudtsoorn, Port Elizabeth and George. I have traveled a bit of the world visiting 17 countries, I love nature and from my traveling found inspiration in creativity from different sorces. I have worked as a photographers assistant, front-door Receptionest, and have experienced working within a corporate environment at Capitec Bank as a Administrator for the SAP system. I completed my educational career with a Marketing Diploma and with the skills I have, such as being detail-oriented, perseverance and determination, I have come to find my passion in Web Development. I find joy in working as a team and seeing projects through to the end aswell as taking pride in my work and what I have accomplished. </p>
